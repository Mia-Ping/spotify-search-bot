## Recommendation

Based on the requirements and analysis, **Render** appears to be the most suitable platform for hosting the Spotify Music Search Bot because:

1. It offers a free tier that doesn't sleep (unlike Heroku)
2. It has good support for Python/Flask applications
3. It provides environment variables for secure configuration
4. It offers GitHub integration, which aligns with the user's preference for GitHub deployment
5. It can handle the expected user load (approximately 100 users)
6. It has a straightforward deployment process

The main limitation is persistent storage, but we can adapt the application to use temporary storage or external services if needed.

## Implementation Plan for Render

1. Create a Render account
2. Connect to the user's GitHub repository
3. Configure the application with appropriate environment variables
4. Set up a web service with the Python runtime
5. Deploy the application
6. Configure custom domain (if available)
7. Monitor performance and adjust as needed
